A comprehensive data analysis project focused on uncovering patterns, trends, and insights from a publicly available dataset on COVID-19 clinical trials.

🔍 Project Overview
This project explores the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic through clinical research. Using Python and Power BI, we perform detailed exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of clinical trials across phases, statuses, age groups, and time.

📁 Dataset
Source: Public COVID-19 Clinical Trials Dataset (CSV format)

Fields: Trial Status, Phase, Start Date, Enrollment Size, Conditions, Age Group, Outcome Measures, Locations, and more.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, Squarify

Google Colab: Data cleaning, EDA, and visualization

📊 Key Analyses
Univariate Analysis:

Trial status distribution (Active, Completed, Terminated, etc.)

Clinical phase distribution (Phase 1–4)

Age group analysis (Children, Adults, Seniors)

Bivariate Analysis:

Status vs. Phase (stacked bar & heatmap)

Conditions vs. Outcome Measures (scatter plot & word cloud)

Time Series Analysis:

Monthly trend of trials started over time

Rolling average for smoothing trends

📌 Key Insights
Majority of trials were in Phase 2 and 3, with focus on adults and elderly.

Sharp spike in trials from March–July 2020 indicating rapid research response.

COVID-19, pneumonia, and respiratory-related conditions were most studied.

Fewer pediatric trials, likely due to ethical limitations and safety concerns.

🚀 Future Improvements
Integrate geographic visualizations (map-based insights)

Predict trial success rates using ML models
